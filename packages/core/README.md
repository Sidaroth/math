## Features
- **Comprehensive** geometry primitives - vectors, points, lines, polygons, circles, and more.
- **Deterministic** and precise - focuses on numerical stability and predictable floating-point behavior.
- **Performance-first** - minimal allocations, lazy evaluation, and lightweight class structures.
- **Self-contained** - zero external dependencies.
- **TypeScript-first** - strong typing, JSDoc annotations, and inline documentation.
- **Clean** API - intuitive methods and naming conventions consistent across types.

## Design Philosophy
- **Predictable, not magical** - all functions behave transparently with no hidden side effects.
- **Data-oriented where possible** - easy to interop with WebGL, Pixi, or compute pipelines.
- **Balance clarity and performance** - readable code that’s still fast enough for real-time use
- **Protect users from pitfalls** - immutable or read-only outputs where mutation is unsafe.
- **Testable** - built with repeatability and isolation in mind so results are consistent and verifiable by tests. Aims for 100% coverage.
- **Lazy** - internal state (like area, centroid, or length) is recalculated only when accessed, avoiding unnecessary work while maintaining correctness.
